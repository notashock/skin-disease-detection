# Skin Disease Classification Pipeline

This repository contains a pipeline for testing and evaluating skin disease classification using a combination of pre-extracted image features and trained machine learning models.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal is to predict skin disease categories from test images using a hybrid feature-based approach. This project includes:

- A set of test images (`new_images/`)
- Precomputed features (`extracted_features/`)
- Trained models for dimensionality reduction and classification (`.pkl` files)
- A Jupyter notebook (`combi_classif.ipynb`) to run inference on new data

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-disease-classification.git
   cd skin-disease-classification
````

2. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook combi_classif.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to:

   * Load new image features
   * Apply PCA
   * Classify with the XGBoost model
   * Output predictions for each test image

## 🛠 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`
* `xgboost`
* `joblib`
* `opencv-python` *(if you plan to extract features again)*

Add a `requirements.txt` file to track these dependencies (optional but recommended).

---

## 📊 Models

* **PCA Model:** Used for dimensionality reduction of extracted image features.
* **XGBoost Classifier:** Predicts skin disease class from reduced feature vectors.

Models are stored in `.pkl` format and loaded using `joblib`.

## 📸 Notes on Image Data

The `new_images/` folder contains test samples used for classification. Ensure the images match the expected preprocessing pipeline (e.g., resizing, normalization) that was applied during training.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add model evaluation metrics
* Support more skin disease categories
* Build a web-based prediction interface
* Integrate deep learning models for end-to-end pipelines
